Features to implement right now:
- Tag aliases
- Searching for both tags and words at the same time (e.g. diary search -w word1 word2 -t tag1 tag2 -w word3)
- Toggle between searching for all or any search terms

- Get diary range to support date ranges

- Print a version number with --version

- Decide on definitive referencing notation, should be able to mix different types of identifier, have search results/be dynamic, reference single entries or ranges or lists of ranges, etc.

- Installation/build script

- Decide what database package I want to use, make sure it is available on all systems that I plan to deploy on.

- Backup script and the ability to restore from a backup easily. Have both incremental and full backups. Schedule them regularly. 





Nodes/data storage:
- Sync current session/viewing stack (current search results, current position in them, half completed entires, etc.)
- Ids incorporate a date for referencing specific versions of an entry
- Bookmarks to reference commonly used entries, use bookmarks as dynamic ids
- Viewing stack
- Opening a new node from the current node adds the new node to the current stack, going back down goes to the previous node and loses the current one
- Alternatively make it so that opening a node from the current node goes 'sideways' in the current stack and opening an unrelated node goes up
- Alternatively make it so that zooming in to view nodes embedded in another node adds another item to the stack and just viewing a related node goes sideways
- Have multiple stacks, switch between them with Ctrl-Tab
- Can reference specific existing entries or can have dynamic ids which refer to different entries depending on current state of database
- Have dynamic ids that can get locked into a current specification with a timestamp
- Ability to resolve dynamic ids and have them become specific ids
- One id can reference multiple entries or have separate system for referencing multiple entries?
- Subranges of other ranges, how to make it efficient?, do certain parts first, e.g. limit ranges first and then do searches
- There are real nodes and virtual nodes, real nodes correspond to a real database entry (possibly a diary entry)
- There are real edges and virtual edges, real edges exist in a database, virtual edges are generated when necessary
- Alternatively have edges existing inside other nodes and only be one way (probably not though)
- Virtual nodes show relationships that change over time or which aren't fixed in stone
- Node factories to load in existing real nodes and generate not currently existing virtual nodes
- Search nodes are virtual nodes which are generated by node factories, they contain a list of all the relevant results, can browse the list or browse the chain of nodes
- Embed nodes within other nodes, can zoom in to see a close up view of the nodes within another node
- Parameterized nodes (real and virtual) to give additional information like search terms and current date, etc. 
- Reference already existing virtual nodes 
- Start tracking useful statistics early. I don't have to implement the entire tracking system straight away, I just have to start recording useful information so that when I do implement the other stuff I'll have a dataset to test it on. Track view counts and search counts and other information to help with this.

- Links correspond to similarities between entries, typing could filter the links and pressing space could select the top one.
- Links could be learned from remembering what I did after viewing that entry last time. 

- Updates are given ids based on their device name and a sequence number, numbers cannot be missed out unless the next update specifically says that the previous numbers were skipped
- How to deal with anonymous devices, devices pre-"the new system" and temporary devices like web browsers from new computers
- Ad-hoc syncing between devices when no internet connection is available, allow syncing between devices with no central server, i.e. make it distributed
- Track changes in a file every time it is saved, alternatively I could track every single keystroke
- Update based, actual representation of data should be platform specific, makes it easy to change format

- Dynamic preloading ability (that is, learn from previous searches how many results are likely to be needed to be preloaded)
- Lazy generation/loading of nodes

- Support for arbitrary documents and not just diary entries. Treat diary entries as a specific case of a document. 
- Have complete edit histories of documents and the ability to view a snapshot of a document at any point in its history. Make previous versions searchable.




LaTeX/formatting:
- Cache html for entries
- Edit files in rich text format and have the ability to make thing bold/coloured?, do this as well as using LaTeX?
- How to have tags in LaTeX?
- Could try to use hashes although I don't know whether it would work or not
- Could just use backslashes although that means I can't make any word a tag, might not be a bad thing
- Could define new tags with \newtag{tagname} 
- Could have anonymous tags with \tag or could have abbreviations, \t
- Could have tag scope, could end tags with \e<tagname>, end anon tag with \et
- Could have any word as a tag with \tag{tagname} without having to define one specifically
- \newtag{tagname} could be an alias for making a new LaTeX command if I can do that, need to find a way to make all tags persistent
- Tags can carry other data, e.g. \film{name_of_film}, could act as a way to give a title to an entry
- Allow python code in LaTeX entries with the python extension (what other extensions to allow)
- Impose formatting restrictions, automatic or self enforced, use syntax highlighting to let self know when broken
- Meaning of double and single quotes?
- When browsing through previous entries have a way to skip over the ones not related to that time period
- How to format programming terms or things that I want to be printed in a monospaced font?
- Need to be able to differentiate between really important entries and every day sort of stuff entries
- Take quotes from long diary entries and print them in a large font in the middle of the page to break up the wall of text
- Marker for incomplete diary entries
- How to split up long entries when only part of the entry is relevant for the search result, allow multiple views of the same entry, each one widening the scope until the whole entry is visible
- Private command/environmental variable to make stuff hidden unless a password is entered
- How to handle old entries, treat them as plain text or convert them to LaTeX and treat them as LaTeX, I could just verbatim the whole entry and then treat it as LaTeX
- \date{date} command for talking about and formatting dates and times
- \calc{expr} command to calculate simple arithmetic stuff in line, do it in Vim?
- How to handle lists? Just use the LaTeX style of \item?
- \pounds{num} command and related commands (for displaying the correct symbols and for converting to other currencies and doing other special things like searching for all posts that mention an amount of money)
- Number of new lines significant, or just use section commands instead and use existing LaTeX style of handling new lines
- Footnotes?
- Bold/coloured text to make it stand out?
- Style guidelines with syntax highlighting
- Start lines with "DR: " to signify that that line was inserted by a script, use it for reminders, word games, date of current entry, etc. 
- Don't print lines with "DR: " when displaying but allow it with an option
- Attach/quote arbitrary files
- Quote other entries in line and have the quoted parts automatically update when the original entry is updated
- Define new commands within entry text
- Give titles to entries
- Writing verbatim (i.e. ignore macros/tags/all special characters temporarily)
- Recognise dates/times and format/highlight them appropriately
- Emphasize text
- Images/photos/links to online photos
- Have photos taken by myself exist as standalone entries or be associated/embedded with other entries
- Embed figures/diagrams/graphs within entries, have them auto update
- Markers within entries, reference other entries or other markers
- Section/break command to split up long entries into parts, not needed for new entries (I can just use multiple files) but it would be very useful for splitting up old long entries
- Make search results only show the relevant section that the tag appears in
- Decide on the best list format, maybe use the LaTeX format or make it compatibly with LaTeX
- Regular expression diary macros
- Support for plain text, LaTeX, html, others?
- Text formatting, lists
- Automatic replacement of text macros while I type

Tags:
- Hash tag, use a more formal syntax/decide exactly what characters I want to allow in tags
- Tag scope
- Other special tags (like '##')
- Automatic tagging of entries
- Tag aliases, tag stemming
- Searching for one tag also returns results for another but not the other way around
- Tags refer to specific sections of a diary entry, how to talk about tag scope?
- Hash for tag, backslash for macro




Achievements:
- Rewards/points system
- Random rewards, multiple tiers of rewards with different probability distributions, purchasing a film directly costs more than getting a random one
- Different types of points/money for different categories, can change between types for a fee
- Repeatable achievements
- Gamble with points/deposit points and get a larger amount back but only if I complete a certain task (e.g. spend 1000 points now to get 1100 points when I complete an important task, lose the original 1000 points if I never complete the task or don't complete it within the specified constraints)
- Make myself set at least one goal per day
- Rules/strategies to get myself to complete tasks/do the things that I want myself to do


Other:
- Auto-completion of diary commands
- Automatically trim white space at start and end of entries
- Tag analyser that can scan through all entries and provide a summary of what tags are used and how often they are used.

- Show time differences between subsequent search results
- Automated tests
- Status board/splash screen that shows quick summary of goals and entries (extend diary-chain to do that too).
- Allow diary-chain to ignore a certain amount of missed days. Maybe a yellow number indicates that the tag has not occurred today but that the chain won't be broken if it isn't completed today. 
- Improve diary-chain to show simple calendars with red X's or V's for vacations or S's for sick days.
- Diary checklist or simple list of things that I want a constant reminder of, integrate with the splash screen?

- Anki integration
- Evidence based planning integration
- Automatic summary generation?
- Track goals and view summaries of progress
- Focus more on getting the user to writing summaries of entries. Have a two dimensional viewing method where time is one dimension and "level of summary" is another. Maybe add a third dimension for tags. 
- Add a MB count to my diary wordcount script, add MB counts to other types of data like pictures
- Write about certain periods of time and events that happened a long time ago
- Some way to automatically notice and analyse trends in my entries, for example do I write about certain topics more often now?
- Track alertness/happiness over time, display in graphs, use to help determine what makes me happy/alert and what makes me upset/sleepy
- Track my progress towards certain goals, show key points like when I started playing the piano, how often I played, when I reached certain milestones, etc.
- Gantt and PERT charts for general planning, evidence based planning
- Recipe browser, with photos and instructions and ingredient lists. Choose what I want for the week and get a complete shopping list. Can be easily adapted for different numbers of people eating and for different numbers of people doing the cooking. Include my own ratings. Different variations on the same meals, construct complete meals from separate parts. Have Gantt and PERT charts to show what needs to be done. Maybe make this a separate project. 
- Continuous model, just start writing without having to worry about entry boundaries, paragraphs are grouped by closeness in time
- Real time synchronization/backup with outside web server, syncs every keypress/word to reduce backup time
- Scan in handwritten diary entries/other documents.
- Ability to take note of a completed task/goal without having to write about it explicitly
- Combine all different scripts into one application
- Checklist, add items whenever I want, they can stick on it every day, only some days, only once, etc.. Can check items off once done that day
- Have one checklist template and copy the template every day, then use Vim to delete off items as I complete them
- Write diary entries using only a keyboard with no screen. Use Star Trek style tones to notify when I've made a mistake or started a new entry or something.
- Truecrypt to store diary entries/encrypt all diary entries by default
- Persistent documents with version control, ability to search any version of the document, integration with mercurial and file system?
- Ability to use diary-settings interactively/to use it to change the settings as well as just print them, removes the requirement to have a .diaryrc file
- Allow commands to temporarily be executed using a different .diaryrc file/different specified settings
- Have named pipes or lists to collect data from diary entries with the '+<letter> line' syntax, could act as a basic reminder system
- Voice activated diary, the ability to start recording entries using only my voice, integrate with a home server and many microphones around the room
- Reading lists, can add a topic (or article) to a specified reading list, each reading list has a name, maybe limit the number of reading lists, maybe have one per letter of the alphabet (at most) and add thing to the list with +<letter> or something similar
- Favourite articles 
- Counters, could increment with ++, decrement with --, could use other symbols (+=, -=, =, etc.), counters could be initialised to 0 on first reference, could be lists and could add records to the list, could be dictionaries or other python objects
- Counters could be accessed using command line app as well as within entry
- How to write about different "eras" of my life, how to write about smaller times in my life and how to reference them
- Shortcut to repeat the last command, each command can set the value of the next special command? Do this in Vim?
- Simple and quick to use diagram making system, make diagrams out of node structures?
- Diary reminder system that works with an existing task list (e.g. Google Tasks)
- Scope of reminders, one line, one entry?
- Custom dictionaries?
- Write reminders to self in entries and a reminder service to remind self, maybe integrate with a calendar app
- Store settings in an automated mercurial repository, have the ability to view the current settings at any point in time, treat settings like any other persistent document?
- Statistics about what times I write entries in and how much I write at what times of day and so on 
- Indexing, both for tags and for words, I think it would really help speed up everything. Use diary-chain's tag caching system for searching. 
- I could either go with each entry having an index and searching looks through each entry in turn or I could go for having one central index which points to the relevant entries
- Sunrise/sunset times easily viewable
- Splash screen with ASCII graphics or proper graphics when using GUI
- Graphs, make them look pretty and display useful statistics, make them exportable
- Ability to delete entries/have a rubbish bin for deleted entries
- Learning game, show a Vim shortcut or bash command or something and find out what it does, would help in learning Vim/bash/others
- Word of the day game: present self with a new word (plus definition) every time I write a new entry (or once a day) then I must use that word somewhere in the entry and the next word only appears if I do use the given word
- Alternatively I could present myself with words that I might not know the meaning of and try to define it when I see it, I could then compare my definitions with the actual definitions, it could help to increase my vocabulary
- I could only show myself the definition in the next entry to try to increase my long term retention of the data
- Add external files to dairy, add emails, integrate with planned archiving system
- Taskbar integration for diary app (notifications for syncing, etc.)
- Support for audio diary entries (and transcriptions)
- Remind self to review old entries (and maybe to write summaries of them)

- Read it later like service to save articles for offline reading/archiving
- Track time spend doing unapproved activities
- Plan time for playing games/other leisure activities
- Track fitness goals/weight, try to automate as much as possible
- Better searching (with stemming and stop words and caching/indexing, etc.)
- A way to summarise topics and have multiple different layers of summary, e.g. lowest level is to show all entries verbatim, next level is to show a summary of each entry, next level is to show a summary of each day, next level is to show a summary of each week then each month then each year, etc.
- Keep track of arbitrary statistics, e.g. have counters and other variables which can be changed from within diary entries
- View an entry/group of entries in different ways, show snippets from each one, first paragraph, tags, etc.
- Built in dictionary (use Vim?)
