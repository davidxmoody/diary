This list will contain all of the possible features I could add to my diary project. I'm just going to dump everything that I have already written here and then I'll sort through it later. 


Features to implement right now:
- Search term logging
- Searching for both tags and words at the same time (e.g. diary search -w word1 word2 -t tag1 tag2 -w word3)
- Toggle between searching for all or any search terms
- Tag aliases

- Get diary range to support date ranges
- Make dairy wordcount accept ranges of entries and use it's cache for them

- Make scripts use the compressed option notation (-n -a becomes -na, -n 1 becomes -n1)

- 'diary cd' to quickly go to certain key diary directories
- Automaticaly trim white space at start and end of entries

- Print a version number with --version

- Autocompletion of diary commands

- Create new entries with old dates

- Decide on definitive referencing notation, should be able to mix different types of identifier, have search results/be dynamic, reference single entries or ranges or lists of ranges, etc.





Nodes/data storage:
Sync current session/viewing stack (current search results, current position in them, half completed entires, etc.)
Ids incorporate a date for referencing specific versions of an entry
Bookmarks to reference commonly used entries, use bookmarks as dynamic ids
Viewing stack
Opening a new node from the current node adds the new node to the current stack, going back down goes to the previous node and loses the current one
Alternatively make it so that opening a node from the current node goes 'sideways' in the current stack and opening an unrelated node goes up
Alternatively make it so that zooming in to view nodes embedded in another node adds another item to the stack and just viewing a related node goes sideways
Have multiple stacks, switch between them with Ctrl-Tab
Versatile system with multiple ways to reference entries
Can reference specific existing entries or can have dynamic ids which refer to different entries depending on current state of database
Have dynamic ids that can get locked into a current specification with a timestamp
Ability to resolve dynamic ids and have them become specific ids
One id can reference multiple entries or have separate system for referencing multiple entries?
Subranges of other ranges, how to make it efficient?, do certain parts first, e.g. limit ranges first and then do searches
There are real nodes and virtual nodes, real nodes correspond to a real database entry (possibly a diary entry)
There are real edges and virtual edges, real edges exist in a database, virtual edges are generated when necessary
Alternatively have edges existing inside other nodes and only be one way (probably not though)
Virtual nodes show relationships that change over time or which aren't fixed in stone
Node factories to load in existing real nodes and generate not currently existing virtual nodes
Search nodes are virtual nodes which are generated by node factories, they contain a list of all the relevant results, can browse the list or browse the chain of nodes
Embed nodes within other nodes, can zoom in to see  a close up view of the nodes within another node
Lazy generation/loading of nodes
Paramaterized nodes (real and virtual) to give additional information like search terms and current date, etc. 
Reference already existing virtual nodes 
Track view counts and search counts and other information to help with this
Don't have to bother implementing everything straight away, just make a note every time a search is made or an entry is viewed, then I'll have a dataset for when I am ready to start analysing it all
Links correspond to similarities between entries, typing could filter the links and pressing space could select the top one
Updates are given ids based on their device name and a sequence number, numbers cannot be missed out unless the next update specifically says that the previous numbers were skipped
How to deal with anonymous devices, devices pre-"the new system" and temporary devices like web browsers from new computers
Ad-hoc syncing between devices when no internet connection is available, allow syncing between devices with no central server, i.e. make it distributed
Track changes in a file every time it is saved, alternatively I could track every single keystroke
Change history of diary entries, all previous versions are viewable/searchable
Entries as xml files
Use a database package that is available on all platforms
Update based, actual representation of data should be platform specific, makes it easy to change format
Diary list displays new entries as they are written/search results automatically add new entries as they become available
Dynamic preloading ability (that is, learn from previous searches how many results are likely to be needed to be preloaded)
Abstract document class (or nodes instead), they can be edited after creation, have metadata
Edit history and the ability to view a snapshot of a document at any point in history



LaTeX/formatting:
Cache html for entries
Edit files in rich text format and have the ability to make thing bold/coloured?, do this as well as using LaTeX?
How to have tags in LaTeX?
Could try to use hashes although I don't know whether it would work or not
Could just use backslashes although that means I can't make any word a tag, might not be a bad thing
Could define new tags with \newtag{tagname} 
Could have anonymous tags with \tag or could have abreviations, \t
Could have tag scope, could end tags with \e<tagname>, end anon tag with \et
Could have any word as a tag with \tag{tagname} without having to define one specifically
\newtag{tagname} could be an alias for making a new LaTeX command if I can do that, need to find a way to make all tags persistent
Tags can carry other data, e.g. \film{name_of_film}, could act as a way to give a title to an entry
Allow python code in LaTeX entries with the python extension (what other extensions to allow)
Impose formatting restrictions, automatic or self enforced, use syntax highlighting to let self know when broken
Meaning of double and single quotes?
When browsing through previous entries have a way to skip over the ones not related to that time period
How to format programming terms or things that I want to be printed in a monospaced font?
Need to be able to differentiate between really important entries and every day sort of stuff entries
Take quotes from long diary entries and print them in a large font in the middle of the page to break up the wall of text
Marker for incomplete diary entries
How to split up long entries when only part of the entry is relevant for the search result, allow multiple views of the same entry, each one widening the scope until the whole entry is visible
Private command/environmental variable to make stuff hidden unless a password is entered
How to handle old entries, treat them as plain text or convert them to LaTeX and treat them as LaTeX, I could just verbatim the whole entry and then treat it as LaTeX
\date{date} command for talking about and formatting dates and times
\calc{expr} command to calculate simple arethmetic stuff in line, do it in Vim?
How to handle lists? just use the LaTeX style of \item?
\pounds{num} command and related commands (for displaying the correct symbols and for converting to other currencies and doing other special things like searching for all posts that mention an amount of money)
Number of new lines significant, or just use section commands instead and use existing LaTeX style of handling new lines
Footnotes?
Bold/coloured text to make it stand out?
Style guidelines with syntax highlighting
Start lines with "DR: " to signify that that line was inserted by a script, use it for reminders, word games, date of current entry, etc. 
Don't print lines with "DR: " when displaying but allow it with an option
Attach/quote arbitrary files
Quote other entries in line and have the quoted parts automatically update when the original entry is updated
Define new commands within entry text
Give titles to entries
Comments
Writing verbatim (i.e. ignore macros/tags/all special characters temporarily)
Recognise dates/times and format/highlight them appropriately
Emphasize text
Images/photos/links to online photos
Have photos taken by myself exist as standalone entries or be associated/embedded with other entries
Embed figures/diagrams/graphs within entries, have them autoupdate
Markers within entries, reference other entries or other markers
Section/break command to split up long entries into parts, not needed for new entries (I can just use multiple files) but it would be very useful for splitting up old long entries
Make search results only show the relevant section that the tag appears in
Decide on the best list format, maybe use the LaTeX format or make it compatably with LaTeX
Regular expression diary macros
Support for plain text, LaTeX, html, others?
Text formatting, lists
Automatic replacement of text macros while I type
Define functions within the text of an entry
Syntax highlighting (use LaTeX?)



Tags:
Hash tag, use a more formal syntax/decide exactly what characters I want to allow in tags
Tag scope
Other special tags (like '##')
Automatic tagging of entries
Tag aliases, tag stemming
Searching for one tag also returns results for another but not the other way around
Tags refer to specific sections of a diary entry, how to talk about tag scope?
Hash for tag, backslash for macro




Achievements:
- Rewards/points system
- Random rewards, multiple teirs of rewards with different probability distributions, purchasing a film directly costs more than getting a random one
- Different types of points/money for different categories, can change between types for a fee
- Repeatable achievements
- Gamble with points/deposit points and get a larger amount back but only if I complete a certain task (e.g. spend 1000 points now to get 1100 points when I complete an important task, lose the original 1000 points if I never complete the task or don't complete it within the specified constraints)
- Make myself set at least one goal per day
- Rules/strategies to get myself to complete tasks/do the things that I want myself to do

- Continuous model, just start writing without having to worry about entry boundaries, paragraphs are grouped by closeness in time
- Real time syncronization/backup with outside web server, syncs every keypress/word to reduce backup time
- Scan in handwritten diary entries
- Ability to take note of a completed task/goal without having to write about it explicitly
- Combine all different scripts into one application
- Checklist, add items whenever I want, they can stick on it every day, only some days, only once, etc.. Can check items off once done that day
- Have one checklist template and copy the template every day, then use Vim to delete off items as I complete them

- Persistent documents with version control, ability to search any version of the document, integration with mercurial and file system?
- Ability to use diary-settings interactively/to use it to change the settings as well as just print them, removes the requirement to have a .diaryrc file
- Allow commands to temporarily be executed using a different .diaryrc file/different specified settings
- Have named pipes or lists to collect data from diary entries with the '+<letter> line' syntax, could act as a basic reminder system
- Voice activated diary, the ability to start recording entries using only my voice, integrate with a home server and many microphones around the room
- Reading lists, can add a topic (or article) to a specified reading list, each reading list has a name, maybe limit the number of reading lists, maybe have one per letter of the alphabet (at most) and add thing to the list with +<letter> or something similar
- Favourite articles 
- Counters, could increment with ++, decrement with --, could use other symbols (+=, -=, =, *=, etc.), counters could be initialised to 0 on first reference, could be lists and could add records to the list, could be dictionaries or other python objects
- Counters could be accessed using command line app as well as within entry
- How to write about different "eras" of my life, how to write about smaller times in my life and how to reference them
- Shortcut to repeat the last command, each command can set the value of the next special command? do this in Vim?

- Statistics about what times I write entries in and how much I write at what times of day and so on 
- Indexing, both for tags and for words, I think it would really help speed up everything
- I could either go with each entry having an index and searching looks through each entry in turn or I could go for having one central index which points to the relevant entries
- Sunrise/sunset times easily viewable
- Splash screen with asci graphics or proper graphics when using GUI
- Graphs, make them look pretty and display useful statistics, make them exportable
- Ability to delete entries/have a rubbish bin for deleted entries
- Learning game, show a Vim shortcut or bash command or something and find out what it does, would help in learning Vim/bash/others
- Word of the day game: present self with a new word (plus definition) every time I write a new entry (or once a day) then I must use that word somewhere in the entry and the next word only appears if I do use the given word
- Alternatively I could present myself with words that I might not know the meaning of and try to define it when I see it, I could then compare my definitions with the actual definitions, it could help to increase my vocabulary
- I could only show myself the definition in the next entry to try to increase my long term retention of the data
