#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Command line args:
# - Maybe specify only one tag to display.
# - Maybe change format of displayed text.
# - Enable/disable colour.
# - Add or remove tags to the list of monitored tags.
# - Rebuild cache.

# Algorithm for calculating chains:
# - Scan through all diary entries (or all entries modified since last scan).
# - For each one if it has any tag in it, write a log entry with the entry's .
#   timestamp and that tag (in the case of more than one tag in an entry, 
#   write multiple log entries).
# - Sort by timestamp (or assume it's already sorted).
# - Starting with the most recent timestamp, work backwards and make a note
#   every time a tag is encountered. Tag aliases or some form of regular 
#   expressions may be needed.
# - Every time a tag is encountered check to see if the last time that tag was
#   encountered was the previous day. If it was then increment the 
#   corresponding counter. If it wasn't then the corresponding counter is left
#   with the length of the longest chain (so stop considering that tag).
